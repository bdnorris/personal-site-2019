          <p>Very much *in progress* and *untested*, this is a little static site generator I put together to utilize my favorite tools with some opinionated Sass starter files.</p>
          <p>It uses Pug or HTML, Sass, and a great little library called webpack-stream that allows Webpack style JS module compilation to be used with Gulp. Meant for little sites where you want some developer convenience but don't want to go with a full framework.</p>
          <p>It also has an option to inject styles to the head of your HTML instead, making it good for developing landing pages that have to get pasted into a third party system.</p>

            This project started when my friend Joey had compiled a list of haiku phrases in a Google Spreadsheet and asked if I could do anything interesting with it. <a href="https://github.com/bdnorris/haiku/">This was the result</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling like the idea had some legs, I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn a little <a href="https://www.meteor.com/#!">Meteor.js</a>. I created an app that would randomly pull five or seven syllable lines from a Mongo DB. Meteor made it trivially easy to add an administrative backend to enter new lines, or delete old ones.

            Codepen is a really great tool and perfect for working out and storing code snippets and UI elements. I thought a good way to use this tool would be to creating common web UI components into a library of pens. Each pen is meant to do one thing, that could then be picked up and integrated into a website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also felt I was too reliant on jQuery, and wanted to get more experience writing UI components and manipulating the DOM with modern, vanilla javascript. A work in progress, I will add more as I complete them.

          <p>While working on the idea for the first student project in DES-440, it occurred to me that a very popular affect on the web is animating items as they come into the viewport, and it was likely I would be asked how this was done.</p>
          <p>A popular library for this is <a href="https://wowjs.uk/">Wow.js</a>. But I thought it would be useful and educational to attempt to write my own. I ended up working with it a bit and letting students use it on their projects.</p>
          <p>Itâ€™s is dependent on jQuery though. Since I wrote this, I've found <a href="https://github.com/terwanerik/ScrollTrigger">ScrollTriggers by Erik Terwan</a>. It solves the exact same problem with a lot more features and it's just vanilla Javascript.</p>
